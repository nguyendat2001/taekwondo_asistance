## abstract

Practicing sports is an activity that helps people maintain and improve people's health, enhance memory and concentration, reduce anxiety and stress, and train teamwork and leadership ability. Nowadays, with the development of science and technology, the application of artificial intelligence in sports has become more and more popular to the public and brings many benefits. In particular, many applications help people track and evaluate athletes' achievements in competitions. This study extracts images from Taekwondo videos and generates skeleton data from frames using the Fast Forward Moving Picture Experts Group (FFMPEG) technique using MoveNet. After that, we use deep learning architectures such as Long Short-Term Memory networks, Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory, and Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Networks to perform the poses classification tasks in TAEGEUK IN JANG lessons. This work presents two approaches. The first approach uses a sequence skeleton extracted from the image by Movenet. Second, we use sequence images to train using video classification architecture. We recognize poses in sports lessons using skeleton data to remove noise in the image, such as background and extraneous objects behind the exerciser. As a result, our proposed method has achieved high data accuracy  in a basic Taekwondo lesson.

## result



this is project we built by tensorflow, openCV and deployed by Flaks and Flask_SQL
if you want to run that project you just run file server_test.py
``` shell
python server_test.py
```
that website is built with two main fuctions (evaluation lesson 1 taekwondo and mentor  instruct student how to learn lesson 1 taekwondo)
